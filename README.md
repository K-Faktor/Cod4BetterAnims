# Cod4BetterAnims Beta
#### Replaces the death anims in cod4 with better ones.
###### I do not own the weapons.gsc file, I believe starker made that, it is simply responsible for adding the holdguns mod.
###### Also this is a beta. There are many issues still. Use only if you understand it's not perfect yet.
